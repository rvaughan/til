# Data Freshness

Whilst building some code which processed Google Analytics v4 report data I found that the "freshness" of the data returned was not immediate as it is in the online console. Based on the information on [this](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12233314#data-processing) page is seems as though the data can be delayed by up to 24 hours from when it was originally triggered.
