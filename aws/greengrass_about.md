# AWS Greengrass

[AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/) allows you to deploy AWS Lambda functions to your hardware on the edge. These lambda can be written using any of the supported AWS Lambda runtimes, including Python, Java and C++, and they can react to messages published through the [AWS IoT Core MQTT service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html). These functions can seamlessly access any other AWS service - so long as they have permissions to do so â€” meaning that you are able to simply use the standard AWS SDK.
