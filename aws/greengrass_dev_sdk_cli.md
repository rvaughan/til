# Greengrass Development SDK CLI

To do development on your laptop, you need to install the Greengrass Development SDK CLI. The instructions for that are on [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-development-kit-cli.html) page, but it essentially comes down to:


```bash
python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/aws-greengrass/aws-greengrass-gdk-cli.git@v1.1.0
```
